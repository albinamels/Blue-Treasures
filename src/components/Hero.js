          Kyrgyzstan's rippling mountain landscape is topped with stark
          glaciers, accented with energetic rivers, and covered with just shy of
          2,000 lakes, making it the most vibrant and green of all the Central
          Asian counties. The alpine lakes of Kyrgyzstan are particularly
          beautiful facets of the country that Kyrgyz people take great pride
          in.
